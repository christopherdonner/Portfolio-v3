# Portfolio-v3

## Project Overview:
### I wanted to add functionality to the contact me page so I decided to re-write my portfolio page in Node.js with to store visitor's messages in a MySQL database.

I don't have the contact me page actually working yet but that was a big drive to doing this in node.
Ultimately, I intend to have the projects pull from the database.
handlebars became really useful with putting the header and footer in the layout that all the views reference.
